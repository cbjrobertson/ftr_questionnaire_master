# data subsetting by publication

This readme is designed to help interested researchers (and reviewers) re-construct the methods presented in Robertson & Roberts (2020). _Not when but if: Modality and future time reference in English, Dutch, and German_ PsyArxiv. DOI: [https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/gdr8e](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/gdr8e); and  Robertson, Roberts, Dunbar, & Majid (in prep.). _Future time reference and temporal discounting: experimental evidence suggests the importance of probability.

# Not when but if
## Study 1
### Version A
The items which are used in analysis can be generated by subsetting `questions.xlsx` such that: `in_e1 == "in"` (the items which were presented to participants); `e1_intersection == "in"` (the matched sample of these items); `miscode_cut == "ok"` (to cut questions which included modality/tense words); and  `understand == "understood"` (to cut questions which participants misunderstood). Additionally, in the second wave of German data collection, 3 items had to be removed because the context included an utimate time reference which was, at that point, in the past. These can be generated by further subsetting such that `question_no` is not in `[37,38,39]`. 

### Version B
The 29 items which were presented to participants in the FTR elicitation task can be generated by subsetting `questions.xlsx` such that `e2_&_e4 == "in"`. On these, 2 item was cut because inclusion of modal or tense words in the prompt make answers impossible for the FTR classifier to identify. These can be created by  further subsetting such that `miscode_cut == "ok"`; and 2 item was cut because participants appeared to misunderstand the question as refering to present time. This can be generated by setting `understand == "understood"`. However one item was in obth these categories, so a total of 3 items were cut. For the data collection that occurred in 2018 and later, 2 items which referred to present or past time can be cut by further subsetting such that `question_no` is not in `[37,38,39]`. This leaves a total of 26 items for the pre-2018 data, and 24 for the post-2018 data.

# Future time reference and temporal discounting
## study 1
### Version A
The 29 items which were presented to participants in the FTR elicitation task can be generated by subsetting `questions.xlsx` such that `e2_&_e4 == "in"`. 

One items were cut because inclusion of modal or tense words in the prompt make answers impossible for the FTR classifier to identify. These can be created by  further subsetting such that `miscode_cut == "ok"`; 1 item was cut because participants appeared to misunderstand the question as refering to present time. This can be generated by setting `understand == "understood"`; and 1 item was cut because it was in both these categories.

### Version B
Follow the instructions for Version A to generate the items which were excluded from analysis in Version B. Two items were additionally cut from Version B because inclusion of a (then past time) ultimate time reference ("by 2018") meant that by the time of Version B data collection, this referred to past time. These can be generated by further subsetting such that `question_no` is not in `[37,38,39]`. 

## study 2
All items in `questions_e3.xlsx` were presented to participants in study 2. 

The items which were cut because inclusion of modal or tense words in the prompt make answers impossible for the FTR classifier to identify can be generated by  subsetting such that `miscode_cut == "ok"`, and items which were cut because participants appeared to misunderstand the question as refering to present time can be generated by setting `understand == "understood"`. In this case, the item which was cut because inclusion of a (then past time) ultimate time reference is indexed by `miscode_cut`.
