# Readme

This readme is designed to help interested researchers re-construct the methods presented in Robertson & Roberts (2020), and in Robertson, Roberts, Dunbar, & Majid (2020).

These versions of the FTR questionnaire were used to gather data in four experiments, which we refer to here consecutively as numbers 1-4. These correspond to the experiment numbers given in Robertson & Roberts (2020). Because Robertson, Roberts, Dunbar, & Majid (2020) uses a matched sample of items across all experiments, item subsetting is not given per experiment.

# data subsetting by publication

## Robertson, Roberts, Dunbar, & Majid (2020).
### experiments one and three
The items which are used in the analyses in Robertson, Robertson, Dunbar, & Majid (2020) can be generated by subsetting `questions.xlsx` such that: `used_to_calc_means == 'in'`.

### experiment two
The items which are used in the analyses in Robertson, Robertson, Dunbar, & Majid (2020) can be generated by subsetting `questions_e3.xlsx` such that: `used_to_calc_means == 'in'`.


## Robertson & Roberts (2020)

### experiment one
The items which are used can be generated by subsetting `questions.xlsx` such that: `miscode_cut == "ok"`,  `understand == "understood"`, and `e1_uploaded == "in"`. The matched sample generated by additionally subsetting such that  `e1_intersection == "in"`.

### experiment two 
The items which are used can be generated by subsetting `questions.xlsx` such that: `e2_&_e4 == "in"`, `miscode_cut == "ok"`, and `understand == "understood"`.

### experiment three
 The items which are used can be generated by subsetting `questions_e3.xlsx` such that: `miscode_cut == "ok"`, and `understand == "understood"`.
 
 ### experiment four
Identically to experiment two, the items which were used can be generated by subsetting `questions.xlsx` such that: `e2_&_e4 == "in"`, `miscode_cut == "ok"`, and `understand == "understood"`.


## further notes
Readers will note that the questions which comprise the test battery in experiment three are different from those in exps. 1, 2, and 4. However, some questions are the same. These are indexed by the `uneek` collumn, i.e. questions with the same value of `uneek` are identical between `questions.xlsx` and `questions_e3.xlsx`.
